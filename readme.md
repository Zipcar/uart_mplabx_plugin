# MPLabX Simulator UART I/O Plug-in
This is a plug-in for MPLabX v4.20, which support basic UART reading and injection.
The plug-in reads and writes to pre-configured request and response paths that are 
external to the simulator, and allow interaction with the developer's platform of choice
for simulating peripherals (Modem, GPS, etc.) The possibilities are endless!
